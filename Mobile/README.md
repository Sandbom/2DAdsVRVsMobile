### To the left the player sees their current score, the high score and the current point-multiplier, players can earn this multiplier by slicing by not losing a life while accumulating fruit slices. To the top-right is the players lives, they start with 5 lives and there is no way to gain additional health once it has been lost.

### Bombs are present to avoid players swiping fast across the screen and forces them to consider each object present. Slicing a bomb makes the player lose 1 heart or life point.

### When the player has lost all 5 lives, they have lost the game and may play again, the score is saved and a high score is tracked.
